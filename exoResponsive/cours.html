                        Harry pulled open his bag and handed over the bundle of chicken legs and bread.
                        "Thanks," said Sirius, opening it, grabbing a drumstick, sitting down on the cave floor,
                        and tearing off a large chunk with his teeth.
                        "I've been living off rats mostly. Can't steal too much food from Hogsmeade;
                        I'd draw attention to myself."

                        Said Harry angrily. "A great big dragon keeps popping up in my head for some reason...Okay, try again. . . ."
                        He wanted to skip Divination to keep practicing, but Hermione refused point-blank to skive off Arithmancy,
                        and there was no point in staying without her. He therefore had to endure over an hour of Professor Trelawney,
                        who spent half the lesson telling everyone that the position of Mars with relation to Saturn at that moment
                        meant that people born in July were in great danger of sudden, violent deaths.

                        "Well, that's good," said Harry loudly, his temper getting the better of him,
                        "just as long as it's not drawn-out. I don't want to suffer."
                        Ron looked for a moment as though he was going to laugh;
                        he certainly caught Harry's eye for the first time in days,
                        but Harry was still feeling too resentful toward Ron to care.
                        He spent the rest of the lesson trying to attract small objects
                        toward him under the table with his wand.

                        Harry and Ron went slowly upstairs to their dormitory.
                        As Harry pulled on his pajamas, he looked over at Nevilles bed.
                        True to his word to Dumbledore, he had not told Ron and Hermione about Neville's parents.
                        As Harry took off his glasses and climbed into his four-poster, he imagined how it must feel
                        to have parents still living but unable to recognize you.<br><br>
                        Then he remembered the milk-white face of the screaming boy and realized
                        with a jolt that he had died a year later. . . . It was Voldemort, Harry thought,
                        staring up at the canopy of his bed in the darkness, it all came back to Voldemort. ...
                        He was the one who had torn these families apart, who had ruined all these lives. . . .
                        Ron and Hermione were supposed to be studying for their exams, which would finish
                        on the day of the third task, but they were putting most of their efforts into helping Harry prepare.
